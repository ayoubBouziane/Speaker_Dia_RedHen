just use ALIZE_spk_seg/spk_det.sh

#Using PyCASP
User can also use PyCASP based diarization system :
Check "pycasp" folder for instructions.

#Using LIUM

Below Modules are primarily for running LIUM diarization system :

# Module 1
This will extract 16kz audio date from Mp4 files and divide them according to respective news network
Data-PreProcessing

Requirements :
     1. Python (ofcourse, wrapper is in python)

python 01_pre-processing.py |path-to-mp4-data| |output_name|

#Module 2
This module takes input the data folder created in previous step and do produces diarization output for each audio with data organized similarly to audio folder with name <inp>_seg

python 02_single_show_diarization.py |path-to-audio-data|

#Module 3
Cross-show diarization : Still under development

Note :
"Scripts" folder contains supporting/utility scripts for the pipeline.
